# knights-travails

[Assignment] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) completed as part of [The Odin Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) curriculum.

The script implements a graph data structure and a breadth-first
search algorithm to find the shortest path between two squares for a knight piece on a chessboard. A knight can only move three squares
at a time in an "L" shape. 

Possible moves from each square are stored in the graph data structure. Edges are then added between squares where a move is possible. The shortest possible path between two squares is printed
to the console.
